# Cpp Template Vector Library
This is based on an similar project I worked on to add a similar syntax to c# which failed mostly due to how unsuited its generics are to this purpose. It might still be stretch to say generics in general are the correct to for this but it is at least possible in C++ using templates and this is just a personal project so it does not really matter if it fails apart.

Project started at https://github.com/JoshuaWierenga/VariableSizedVectors/tree/CppVersion, if possible I will migrate the commits over.
